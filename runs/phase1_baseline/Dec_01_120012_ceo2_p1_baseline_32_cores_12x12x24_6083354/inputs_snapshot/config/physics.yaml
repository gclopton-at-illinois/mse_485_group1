# config/physics.yaml  — Phase 1 “boosted signal” physics card for CeO2 TTM–MD
# Drop-in replacement for your current physics.yaml.
# Key changes vs baseline:
#   - Se:         27  → 45   eV/Å   (stronger spike)
#   - r0_nm:      4.5 → 3.0  nm     (more compact deposition → higher peak energy density)
#   - tau_ps:     0.25 → 0.20 ps    (sharper in time)
#   - g0_W_m3K:   7.4e16 → 1.1e17   (modest ↑ in e–l coupling)
#   - rim γ:      1.0 → 0.3 ps⁻¹    (less over-drain at boundary)
#
# Notes:
#   - Electron boundary temperature should be 300 K (typically set in inputs/ttm/grid.yaml).
#   - With in.main.lmp now using `reset_timestep 0` before the spike, the pulse
#     is effectively centered at t = 0 ps; no separate t0 is required.
